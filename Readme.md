#### Project Overview
## To fetch data from an API using .then and async-await. Handle the promise using both methods, .then and using async await

## The link for the GET API is https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=10&page=1&sparkline=false

## Store the array of 10 objects, each containing a name, id, image, symbol, current_price, and total_volume properly so that we can access it later on to display data.

## Display all of them in the form of a table as given in the UI.

# Icon and Name of the coin together
# Percentage change should be green when positive and red when negative
# $ sign shall be added at all places shown in the Figma File
# All 6 columns shall be displayed
# Styling should be exactly the same as shared.

## The project must be deployed.
